## checkra1n-decompiled
The obvious title should give it away by now. But anyways this is decompiled code to hopefully make people understand it better.

Use Ghidra from https://ghidra-sre.org/ to open the project file and view the decompiled code as I didn't wanna bother dumping all of it.

### there are two branches for each version of checkra1n.

Master Branch is Linux, macOS branch is well macOS.
